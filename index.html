<h4 id="e3" class="text"><i>History</i></h4>
<p class="text">Born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. He was 10-years-old when he developed an interest in computers, this new interest was most likely developed as a way to ignore the stresses of his life at the time, being that his parents were in the middle of a divorce. After falling in love with computers, Musk taught himself how to program and at the age of 12, he sold his first software: a game called Blastar. In grade school, Musk was an introvert and was badly bullied until he was 15 after he hit a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself with karate and wrestling. When he turned 17, he moved to Canada, attending Queen’s University and avoiding mandatory service in the South African military
(White men between ages 17 and 65 must do a mandatory 2 years of service in the South African military), that same year, he obtained his Canadian citizenship because he felt it would be easier to obtain American citizenship if he was a Canadian citizen. At age 26, He left Canada to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania were he graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor’s degree in physics. After leaving Penn, He decided to go to Stanford University in California to get a PhD in energy physics. This did happen though, he dropped out of Stanford after only 2 days, He dropped out to essentially join what was the big boom of the internet at that time. He launched his first company, Zip2 Corporation in 1995 with his brother, Kimbal Musk. After only 4 years of Zip2’s creation, it was purchased by a division of Compaq Computer Corporation for $307 million in cash and $34 million in stock options. In that same year, using the money from the selling of Zip2, the Musks founded X.com, which led to the creation of PayPal the following year. Just 2 years after the creation of Paypal, ebay purchased it in October 2002 for 1.5 billion in stock, earning Musk his first billion, which he used to found SpaceX that same year. 6 years later, in 2008, SpaceX was now well established, and NASA handed them a contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station. 4 years after this contract was signed, SpaceX and in extension Musk made history by being the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Musk was quoted saying during the launch “ "I feel very lucky. ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl." Somehow in the middle of all this, Musk managed to co-found and eventually become CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors. He helped start a company in 2006, Solar City, which a decade later he would make an all-stock deal purchase of SolarCity in order to create more efficient, energy-saving cars. He also created The Boring Company in 2017, a company devoted to boring and building tunnels to try and reduce traffic.
With all of this happening quite quickly, it's no wonder that Elon Musk is now one of the richest people in the world, with a networth of 155.1 billion USD (187.49 billion CAD)</p>
